Variable Operations Update
Boas Version 0.0.4

Interpreter Updates
• Added the ability to perform basic operations on variables. Operations include add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), divide (/), and power (^), with more to be added in future updates.
• Cleaned up how error handling is done by creating new class variables, self.file_path and self.code, to avoid specifying them each time the throwError method is used.

Script Updates
• Added a new script file (boas/scripts/operations.py) that handles dynamic number operations. Using the operator module, I made it easy to create additional operations by adding them to an array defined as VALID_OPERATIONS.
